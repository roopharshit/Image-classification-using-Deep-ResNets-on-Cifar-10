# Image-classification-using-Deep-ResNets-on-Cifar-10
#### ▪ Leveraged PyTorch to build a sophisticated Residual Network (ResNet) model on CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification into 10 distinct categories.
#### ▪ Implemented proprietary data augmentation techniques using numpy, to significantly enhance model training and accuracy
#### ▪ Executed two versions of ResNet, incorporating original and full pre-activation residual blocks with bottleneck designs. This optimization led to a notable increase in model accuracy and efficiency through strategic hyper parameter tuning.
#### ▪ Efficiently deployed GPU resources through TAMU HPRC (High Performance Research Computing) clusters for computational tasks. Utilized tqdm for progress visualization to keep track of model performance.
